## Welcome to the Web Template
This project is a bower package, which can be included into any Ruby on Rails, in order to copy standard files across when starting a new project. The idea is that the project will grow to include templates for other types of applications too.

At the moment, only Ruby on Rails is supported. Check out the [rails guide to get up and running](http://github.com/neilwilliams/web-template/wiki/Rails-Guide).
